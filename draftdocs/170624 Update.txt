- Added locations and rules class
- Added basic verification on locations and rules (e.g. )
- Matched rules - if locations matches the required types a rule is created for the concrete locations.
- Load and save rules and locations.
- Model run code - outputs a trajectory.
- Exact Gillespie implementation using loaded model data.

Todo:
- Basic rules for nitrogen fertiliser.
- More location characteristics (e.g. farmland size, ...)
- Fix the new formula method for propensity functions (e.g so that a formula can be typed and converted into a function using sympy)
- Start technical report.
- First blog entry.

- Meeting Discussion:
Focus on Wheat to start - go upto bread production
Regional farms
