## About Me:

Hi, I'm James and I am a joint Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Warwick. I am interested in exploring the interaction between traditional mathematical methods and newer, computational and statistical methods. Specifically, how such a combination of methods can be applied to solve concrete problems in the "real world".

## Project Background:

This blog site is intended to showcase my [URSS project](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/skills/urss/) "Modelling of Agricultural Supply Chains using Stochastic Supply Chain Models". Here, I will apply core mathematical modelling principles and ideas to the real-world context of supply chains - and develop a concrete implementation with model parameters fitted to actual data.

While supply chain modelling is the focus here, the modelling tools and techniques introduced can be readily applied to other areas (for example, in epidemiology, financial markets, economics, physics, or chemistry).

I am fortunate and grateful to be supervised by [Markus Kirkilionis](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/markus_kirkilionis/). Markus is an Associate Professor at the Warwick Mathematics Institute with broad expertise in complex systems and mathematical modelling.


## The Plan:

I aim to post a project update every week, starting the 17th of June 2024.

The posts will focus on applying mathematical/statistical theory, however, I will introduce supply chain background to contextualise the project work.

This site is a work in progress, if you notice any typos or mistakes, feel free to send me an email.
