# Mathematical Modelling of Complex Systems - Agricultural Supply Chains

## Project Background:

This repository is intended to showcase my [URSS project](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/skills/urss/) "Modelling of Agricultural Supply Chains using Stochastic Supply Chain Models". Here, I will apply mathematical modelling tools and techniques in the context of modelling supply chains - hopefully developing a concrete implementation fitted with model parameters on real-world data. 

Strong and resilient agricultural supply chains are vital in ensuring national food security. This has recently come into focus due to the current geopolitical events and trends, broadly described as deglobalisation.

This project will model stochastic elements of such a supply chain and thereby aim to build resilience in the supply chains. Specifically, by probabilistically modelling across a wide range of scenarios, stakeholders can prepare for realistic contingencies and identify weaknesses in the supply chain.

While supply chain modelling is the focus, the modelling tools and techniques explored can be readily applied to other areas (for example, in epidemiology, financial markets, economics, physics, or chemistry). This repository will hopefully be a good resource for people wishing to learn about mathematical modelling too.

I am fortunate and grateful to be supervised by [Markus Kirkilionis](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/markus_kirkilionis/). Markus is an Associate Professor at the Warwick Mathematics Institute with broad expertise in complex systems and mathematical modelling.

## About Me:

Hi, I'm James Flynn and I am a joint Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Warwick. 

I am interested in exploring the field of mathematical modelling and it's relevance in the context of newer, computational and statistical methods and this is my primary motivator for this project.
